Help Menu
There will be a help menu throughout the game in the various different menus. Each help menu will list the same options as the menu where the help menu was accessed. After listing the options it will give a brief explanation of each choice.


The Story -
	Mount Kabru will be a Text-based RPG that will take players on an adventure through the lowest depths of the plains to the highest peaks in the mountains. The story begins at the top of the mountain where the player will meet an old wise being called the “Mysterious Master”. The player is then asked several questions by the Mysterious Master. Depending on what the player chooses,the answers will assign the player a class: warrior, paladin, wizard.  This way a player may slightly customize their character.

Create a new Character:
	Three questions
If a large tree fell on you and you were trapped, would you:
[ M ] 	push with all your might?
[ W ]	use your will to think it away?

If you are hanging on the edge of a cliff, would you:
[ M ] 	fall, knowing you're strong enough to not perish?
[ W ] 	use your will to drift to the top?

   3.	If you are being enticed by delicious pastries, would you:
[ M ]  	Shove down as much as you can showing off your might?
[ W ]	use your will to resist the temptation to indulge?

 4. 	The fourth question will be based on the assigned class:
Warrior(all might): Warrior, what is the first rule of Fight club? player gives any answer. Response: hmmm… interesting.
Paladin(half might, half will): Paladin, what color is the round side of a borgery? player gives answer. Response: Hmmm… I have never seen one of those before.

Wizard(all will): Wizard, The famous wizard RathMar the Conqueror had a famous spell book, what did he call this book?
Player gives any answer. Response: RathMar was a hamster, you idiot.

The player is then thrown down off the mountain into a town called Wilbur. The people of Wilbur have suffered much due to the wild lands surrounding the town. They know of an ancient folklore passed down through the generations that one individual will rise up and defend the town from the evil monsters. The player will wake up in the tavern, not knowing how he got there, and will talk to the barkeeper. The barkeeper will give the player some guidance and knowledge of how the game works. The player will then continue on his adventure, fulfilling his destiny.

As the player goes on adventures, killing monsters, and leveling up his character, he will one day return to the top of the mountain to once again face the Mysterious Master. If the player is able to defeat the Mysterious Master, he will become the new master. As the new master, the player will find a new hero to protect the town of wilbur.

“Adventure” - map of the mountain shaped like a triangle, see map section.
(the underlined part of the description may change depending on the title of the character. the following text will be seen when the character is at the highest level)

You begin to wonder outside of town looking for trouble. You come across a sign with 4 locations.  The first location says “The Plains - ½ mile”. The second location says “The Jungle - 12 Miles”.

Monster Attacks -
You have been attacked by a * monster name *. Prepare to attack or run away.

[ D ] - Defend
[ C ] - Cast Spell
[ R ] - Run away


Attack: The player makes a melee attack. the damage amount will be based on strength and attack.
Defend: The player defends against an upcoming attack. This will increase the player's dexterity for this fight and will reset to the original when the fight is over.

Cast Spell: The player makes a spell attack. the damage amount will be based on mana and attack.
Run away: Player takes a chance to run away. 60% chance of success.

3 complex equations

chance to miss = dexterity / 100
melee damage = (attack + strength - defence of opponent) + a random number between -2 and 2
Spell damage = (attack + mana - defence of opponent) + a random number between -4 and 4
Potion effects = current stat points + restored points


Calculation of response from tavern owner will have 10 useful responses. once these responses have been displayed in order the tavern owner will have 10 silly responses that mean nothing.

just a brief example of something
if charLevel (less than or equal to <=) 10 {
	response comes out of a loop and will cycle through the 10 responses
else use this equation
	there will be an array of the first 100 numbers of pie. the computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100, say 34 and assign a variable the value at the index 34. the computer will take that variable(1 thru 9) and match it to a prewritten response.

************************************************************************************************************************
Example of the game running:
************************************************************************************************************************

The game starts up and then asks for the person that is playing to enter their User Name

If they do not have a User Name, they will be asked to create one. These are the 2 Possibilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter Desired User Name:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
OR
======================================================================
Enter your User Name:
======================================================================


The Player would then input their new name or current name.


After the player has entered their User Name, they would have a menu that would then display to them this menu


        **********************************************
        Welcome to Mount Kabru, *player name*!
        **********************************************

        Main Menu,
        [ N ] - New Game
        [ S ] - Save Game
        [ L ] - Load Game
        [ H ] - Help!
        [ E ] - Exit


*The Game would then search for an old saved game or create a new saved game.
    **The reason for this is because at the begging of the experience you are not going to be saving.
        Therefore a possible Function would be

                   menuInputError();
                        This would display the text here

                        **"How do you think that you can possibly save nothing? That is just not possible."**

//The Saved game would then be output into a file that could be loaded upon return to game

       Possible functions for this are:

            loadSave();
                This function is meant to locate the file to continue playing their adeventure.

            createNewGame();
                This Function would be used to create a new game.
                        ** A New game is one that starts the player with nothing except the bare essentials.**

            obtainHelp();
                This Functions purpose is to display the full Help Menu

            saveCurrent();
                This Functions purpose is to override the createdNewGame();

                    **Basically this rewrites over the Users game file to always be the most up to date play through their is.**


After the player loads or creates a game they would have two possible outcomes to display

[Option 1]

    if (createNewGame(); == true then display Create New Game menu.)

        Create New Game menu then would display and give the User these options

        ********************************
        Please Create a New Hero:
        ********************************

                createNewHero();
                    This Functions purpose is to allow the player to create a new Hero to play as.
                        they have the possibilty to be of a few classes. Warrior, Wizard and Paladin.

    The PLayer would create a name for their hero


    The Player would then have to Answer these questions.

        There are Three possible outcomes for the player

            If they choose all the questions here about regarding strength they would the be assigned the class of [Warrior]

                Warrior is a Attribute of the class createNewHero();   Or is it? I will have to talk to Phillip about this.
                    The purpose of this function is to create a new Hero with the player Class of Warrior

                        The Warrior has More Strength
                        Still it needs its own functions to set the attributes of a Warrior

    The Way that a Paladin is created is if their are two answers for either Strength or Will.
            Paladin is an Attribute of the createNewHero(); function
                They have Mana and Strength

                    Still it needs its own functions to set the attributes of a

    Now the last possibility for these Question answer is that of WIll

    If a PLayer answers all the Questions with will as an answer they will be assigned the class of Wizard
        Wizard is an attribute of createNewHero();

               Still it needs its own functions to set the attributes of a Wizard.




        	3 questions


        If a large tree fell on you and you were trapped, would you:
        [ M ] 	push with all your might?         [Will]
        [ W ]	use your will to think it away?   [Strength]

        If you are hanging on the edge of a cliff, would you:
        [ M ] 	fall, knowing you're strong enough to not perish? [Strength]
        [ W ] 	use your will to drift to the top?                [Will]

           3.	If you are being enticed by delicious pastries, would you:
        [ M ]  	Shove down as much as you can showing off your might? [Strength]
        [ W ]	use your will to resist the temptation to indulge?    [Will]




         4. 	The fourth question will be based on the assigned class:


        Warrior(all might): Warrior, what is the first rule of Fight club? player gives any answer. Response: hmmm… interesting.


        Paladin(half might, half will): Paladin, what color is the round side of a burglar? player gives answer. Response: Hmmm… I have never seen one of those before.

        Wizard(all will): Wizard, The famous wizard RathMar the Conqueror had a famous spell book, what did he call this book?

            Player gives any answer. Response: RathMar was a hamster, you idiot.

This will use a function to determine the questions asked after number 3. Number 4 will be affected by what class of hero is created.



[Option 2]

If the player did not need to create a new character then they would be taken Directly to the Main menu of the town.


Game menu (Town menu)
 	Welcome to the town of Kabru

[ A ] - Adventure - for more information see the “Adventure” section.
[ P ] - The Pit
[ T ] - Tavern
[ I ] - Inn
[ B ] - Blacksmith
[ H ] - Help Menu
[ Q ] - Quit


// Maybe their needs to be more for the player to do because right now this is a very limited menu and it seems kind of boring\\


The player would then input their command into the keyboard.
