The Story -
	Mount Kabru will be a Text-based RPG that will take players on an adventure through the lowest depths of the plains 
	to the highest peaks in the mountains. The story begins at the top of the mountain where the player will meet an 
	old wise being called the “Mysterious Master”. The player is then asked several questions by the Mysterious Master. 
	Depending on what the player chooses,the answers will assign the player a class: warrior, paladin, wizard.  
	This way a player may slightly customize their character. Once the user creates a new hero, the hero is then 
	thrown down off the mountain into a town called Wilbur. The people of Wilbur have suffered much due to the wild 
	lands surrounding the town. They know of an ancient folklore passed down through the generations that one 
	individual will rise up and defend the town from the evil monsters. The player will wake up in the tavern, not 
	knowing how he got there, and will talk to the barkeeper. The barkeeper will give the player some guidance and 
	knowledge of how the game works. The player will then continue on his adventure, fulfilling his destiny. 

As the player goes on adventures, killing monsters, and leveling up his character, he will one day return to the top 
of the mountain to once again face the Mysterious Master. If the player is able to defeat the Mysterious Master, he 
will become the new master. As the new master, the player will find a new hero to protect the town of wilbur.
